My individual design in Digital Circuit Experiment courses.
The content is specifically for Schematic-input FPGA oriented course assignments.
Achievements might be terrible, that's all I know.
The Program should be use Intel-Quartus series of FPGA developing software for openning and compiling. Quartus-9.1sp2 recommended.
This Repository is done.
